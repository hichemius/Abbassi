This is the project of a bundle that will give you the opportunity of creating rich,beautiful,stuctured data interpretations 
in form of pdf file , that will have statistics and raw entries ,as well as paragraphs , with pre-configured CSS layout , 
which will aim to help adopting the Infographics spirit of sharing data that is difficult to analyse to untrained eyes , like those of social media users.

What's inside?
--------------
For now, nothing .. just the skeleton of the new project.
But the work is on , and in a few days you should see some significant advances.
Come back soon , or just join the fun if you like the idea.
